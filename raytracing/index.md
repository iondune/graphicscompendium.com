In this part, we switch from real-time rendering in OpenGL back to offline rendering, this time using ray tracing.
Ray tracing is a slower but more pure form of rendering that is able to more accurately model a number of real-world illumination phenomena.
As such, the topic of ray tracing is a good medium through which to explore the concept of illumination more deeply.
We'll also take a closer look at some graphics math and geometry.
